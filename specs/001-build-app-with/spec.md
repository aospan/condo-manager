# Feature Specification: Condo Management Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-app-with`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build app with web ui to manage condo residents information like name, address, cars and also allow to register guests and their cars and print parking permit"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a condo manager, I want to manage resident information and guest registrations through a web interface so that I can maintain accurate records of who lives in the building, track their vehicles, and manage temporary guest access with proper parking permits.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a condo manager, **When** I access the web application, **Then** I can view a dashboard with resident and guest management options
2. **Given** I want to add a new resident, **When** I enter their name, address, and vehicle information, **Then** the system saves this information and displays it in the residents list
3. **Given** I need to register a guest, **When** I enter guest details and their vehicle information, **Then** the system creates a temporary guest record with a unique identifier
4. **Given** I have a registered guest, **When** I request to print a parking permit, **Then** the system generates a printable permit with guest details and valid dates
5. **Given** I want to update resident information, **When** I modify their details in the system, **Then** the changes are saved and reflected immediately
6. **Given** I need to remove a guest registration, **When** I delete their record, **Then** the guest information is removed from the system

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a resident has multiple vehicles?
- How does the system handle unlimited guest registrations?
- What happens when trying to print a permit for an expired guest registration?
- How does the system handle duplicate vehicle license plates?
- What happens when resident information is incomplete or invalid?
