# Feature Specification: Embedded Status Notifications

**Feature Branch**: `002-do-not-show`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "do not show popup confirmation messages. Show confirmation as embedded status section within the page itself for better ui/ux"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a condo manager using the system, I want to see confirmation messages and status updates directly within the page interface, so that I don't have to deal with disruptive popup dialogs that interrupt my workflow.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user successfully creates a new resident, **When** the operation completes, **Then** a success message appears in an embedded status section within the residents page
2. **Given** a user attempts to delete a resident, **When** the operation completes, **Then** a confirmation message appears in an embedded status section instead of a popup dialog
3. **Given** a user encounters an error during guest registration, **When** the error occurs, **Then** an error message appears in an embedded status section with clear details
4. **Given** a user is working on any page, **When** they perform any action, **Then** all status messages appear inline without blocking their workflow
5. **Given** a user sees a status message, **When** they perform another action, **Then** the previous status message is replaced or cleared appropriately

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple actions are performed rapidly? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should status messages queue, replace each other, or show multiple simultaneously?]
- How does the system handle very long error messages in the embedded status section?
- What happens when a user navigates to a different page while a status message is displayed?
- How does the system handle status messages when the user's session expires?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display all confirmation messages in an embedded status section within the current page
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all error messages in an embedded status section within the current page  
- **FR-003**: System MUST display all success messages in an embedded status section within the current page
- **FR-004**: System MUST NOT display any popup confirmation dialogs for user actions
- **FR-005**: System MUST NOT display any popup error dialogs for user actions
- **FR-006**: System MUST NOT display any popup success dialogs for user actions
- **FR-007**: System MUST make status messages clearly visible to users without blocking their workflow
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to dismiss status messages manually
- **FR-009**: System MUST automatically clear status messages after [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: timeout period not specified - 5 seconds, 10 seconds, or user-configurable?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle multiple status messages appropriately [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: behavior not specified - queue, replace, or show multiple?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain status message visibility when user scrolls within the page
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure status messages are accessible to users with disabilities

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Status Message**: Represents a notification to the user, containing message text, type (success/error/info), timestamp, and dismissal state
- **Status Section**: Represents the UI component that displays status messages within the page layout
